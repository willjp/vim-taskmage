* `taskmage2.api` defines commands used by vim. continue.

    * play around with, and confirm that `ast.touch` is behaving as expected.

    * correct syntax highlighting of header ids

    * write mtask definition for tagbar

    * re-implement `:TaskMageArchivecompleted` etc.

    * update docs

    * can we convert old taskmage projects to new standards?

    * consider moving iostream into `taskmage.*` package. it has nothing to do with parsing.

    * finally, merge into master.
