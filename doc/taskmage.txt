INTRODUCTION                       *taskmage*
================================================================================

TaskMage is a simple plugin to create/manage tasklists. A TaskMage project
lets you organize tasks into regular files, using a syntax inspired by 
reStructuredText. When tasks are saved, metadata is added automatically, and
the files are stored as JSON files. Completed tasks can be periodically
archived using `:TaskMageArchiveCompleted`.


History:~

I spent a long time using TaskWarrior, and a long time reading up on TODO.txt,
the project where it drew inspiration. Each project tries to solve complex
task-management problems in different ways.

todo.txt, at it's core lets you write tasks in plaintext. Metadata is also
manually added to each task, in a format that is consistent, parsible, and
syntax highlighted. My issue with todo.txt was that it was too much typing,
and I found that the metadata got in the way of what I was trying to do.

Taskwarrior tried to solve this issue by managing tasks through a commandline
interface. You could have several views of your tasks (and create custom views)
which allowed you to dynamically search for tasks, sort by various columns,
add custom columns etc. TaskWarrior could also generate beautiful and motivating 
charts/stats about the tasks you created/accomplished. Dependencies could be added between taskIds forming
very complex dependency chains. This was where it fell apart for me, it took
too long to add/manage dependencies. I found myself creating taskwarrior
tasks, and then linking them to restructured-text files where I could more
quickly manage subtasks. I also didn't like constantly having to type
in the projectname to filter tasks by project, I wanted to manage tasks
in folders, but keep a history and metadata like taskwarrior.

This project is a bit of an experiment that attempts to merge the two 
philosophies.
