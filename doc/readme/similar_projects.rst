Simlar Projects
===============

TaskMage is a much smaller, simpler task-manager than most of these. But I drew very heavy inspiration
from the following fantastic projects. You owe it to yourself to check these out. 


* taskwarrior_: an outstanding commandline task-manager, very extendable, complex dependency-management, task-scoring, reports, and even an android app.
* timewarrior_: a plugin for taskwarrior, with excellent graphs. very noteworthy.
* todo.txt_: the original commandline task-manager
* org_mode_: emacs task-manager, also ported to vim.
